    "The best performance was observed with **2 workers**, as higher counts added process creation and data sharing overhead that outweighed speed gains on this small dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "Parallelism improved performance by utilizing multiple CPU cores to process images concurrently, reducing total time compared to purely sequential execution. However, bottlenecks still exist — mainly due to I/O operations (reading/writing images), process communication overhead, and limited data size where parallel overhead dominates computation time. For larger datasets, the benefits of parallel and distributed processing become more significant."
